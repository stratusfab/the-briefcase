# Contributing to The Briefcase

## Two Types of Work

### 1. Your Project Work (DO NOT contribute back)

When you use The Briefcase for your own projects:
- Clone to a NEW repository
- Customize for your project
- Work in YOUR repo, NOT this template repo
- Your project-specific changes stay in YOUR repo

**DO NOT:**
- Push project-specific commits to stratusfab/the-briefcase
- Submit PRs with your project customizations
- Work directly in a clone of the template

### 2. Template Improvements (Contribute back)

When you want to improve The Briefcase framework itself:

**Examples of template improvements:**
- New Design Principles
- Better operational rules
- New audit tests
- Bug fixes in template structure
- Documentation improvements
- New features for the methodology

**How to contribute:**

1. Fork stratusfab/the-briefcase
2. Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-improvement`
3. Make changes to the TEMPLATE (keep it generic)
4. Test your changes
5. Commit with clear messages: `[category] Description`
6. Push to your fork
7. Open Pull Request to stratusfab/the-briefcase

**Guidelines:**
- Keep changes generic and template-focused
- No project-specific content
- No placeholder values filled in (keep [brackets])
- No actual credentials or sensitive info
- Test that setup.md still works
- Update documentation if needed

## Questions?

- Open an issue for discussion
- Check existing issues/PRs first
- Be clear about whether you're suggesting template improvement vs asking for help with your project

## Protecting The Template

The Briefcase repository should remain:
- ✅ Generic and reusable
- ✅ Clean baseline for new projects
- ✅ Template-only content
- ❌ No project-specific customizations
- ❌ No filled-in placeholders
- ❌ No real project data

Thank you for keeping The Briefcase clean and useful for everyone!
